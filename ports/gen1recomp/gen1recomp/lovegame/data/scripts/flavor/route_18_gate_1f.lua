-- TEXT_ROUTE18GATE1F_GUARD: talking to the gate guard directly (as
-- opposed to walking into his blocking coords, which triggers
-- TEXT_ROUTE18GATE1F_GUARD_EXCUSE_ME plus scripted movement -- not
-- ported here since that's a separate constant/flow, not a talk).
-- text_asm calls Route16Gate1FIsBicycleInBagScript (IsItemInBag
-- BICYCLE) and shows the "Cycling Road is all uphill from here" text
-- if the player has a BICYCLE, or "You need a BICYCLE for CYCLING
-- ROAD!" otherwise.
