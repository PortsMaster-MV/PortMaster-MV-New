-- object is two raw bytes -- item, quantity -- so there is no bytecode for the
-- VM to start; the extractor read the pair into `def.itemball` and this list is
-- the script the cart would have run.
--
-- It is NOT HiddenItemScript with a `disappear` swapped in for the flag write,
-- which is how it read before.  `.TryReceiveItem` (misc_scripts.asm:38) does
-- BOTH the GetItemName into wStringBuffer3 and the ReceiveItem, in one callasm,
-- before a single box is drawn -- so the getitemname and the give both come
-- first here, the full-pocket branch is taken with nothing yet on screen, and
-- its arm prints the found line, waits, and only then prints the "can't carry
-- any more" line.  Three further things the hidden-item shape got wrong: the
-- sound is an unconditional `playsound SFX_ITEM`, not `specialsound` (which
-- would ring SFX_GET_TM for a TM, scripting.asm:476); `disappear` lands BEFORE
-- the text, not after the give; and the success arm holds on `pause 60` under
-- the found line before itemnotify, which is the freeze a pickup is supposed to
-- have and which was missing entirely.
--
-- `disappear` is what stands in for the hidden item's flag write:
-- World:disappearObject sets the object's own event flag
-- (EVENT_GOT_HM07_WATERFALL on the Ice Path ball is the one a run cannot do
-- without), which is what keeps the ball gone across a reload and what a route
-- row's `expect` reads.  The `.no_room` arm never reaches it, so a full pocket
-- leaves the ball findable.
--
-- The pause operand is the cart's literal 60, the same reading every other
-- transcription in the port uses (CmdQueue's `pause 30`, the fishing `pause 40`
-- in World).  Script_pause loops `ld c, 2 / call DelayFrames` per unit, so the
-- hardware holds twice the operand; that factor lives on Vm:pauseFrames, where
-- it fixes every pause at once, rather than being pre-multiplied here.
