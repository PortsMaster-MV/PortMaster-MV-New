-- The `special` command's handlers (data/events/special_pointers.asm).
--
-- Lifted out of src/script/gen2/Vm.lua because the two are different kinds of
-- code: the VM is one interpreter with a shared control flow, and this is 169
-- INDEPENDENT routines that happen to share a dispatch table.  Growing them
-- inside runList's else-chain would have buried the interpreter.
--
-- Dispatch is by NAME.  The script byte is an index into SpecialsPointers,
-- which the extractor turns into constants.specialOrder, and Vm:specialName
-- resolves the one into the other; keying on the label rather than on the
-- number means a repointed table cannot silently call the wrong routine, and
-- it means a test can assert the mapping against the cache.  A Gold cache's
-- order has 112 rows and a Crystal one 169 -- the asm files' `add_special`
-- match counts are one higher each, because they include the MACRO line.
--
-- Three kinds of entry live here:
--
--   HANDLERS  the routine, ported.  Most read or write wScriptVar, so each
--             takes the Vm and leaves its answer in `vm.scriptVar`, exactly
--             as the asm leaves it in wScriptVar.
--   STUBS     deliberately out of scope, with the reason written down and a
--             SANE return rather than a fall-through.  Everything link cable,
--             Mystery Gift and the printer is here: those need a second
--             console or a Game Boy Printer, and a script that asks and gets
--             no answer at all takes the wrong branch.
--   ALL       the merge, which is what Vm.SPECIALS is.  The two sets are
--             disjoint by construction and tests/gen2_vm_test.lua asserts it.
--
-- Everything a handler needs from the game is one call into `vm.specials`, the
-- hook table src/world/gen2/World.lua builds in World:specialHooks.  A handler
-- with no hooks at all still runs and still leaves the right wScriptVar: that
-- is what makes the whole table testable headless.
--
-- BLOCKING.  A handler runs INSIDE the VM's coroutine (runList calls
-- Vm:runSpecial), so it may yield, and Specials.block below is how it parks on
-- a screen: the async work is started first and the coroutine only yields if
-- the callback has not already fired, which is what lets the same handler work
-- against a real pushed screen and against a test stub that answers on the
-- spot.  The parked yield carries a kind Vm:resume does not recognise, and
-- that is deliberate: it means "nothing to do, wait", and the screen's own
-- callback is the only thing that can start the script again.

-- Two cart tables this file USES but must not re-transcribe.  Each already has
-- exactly one home, and a second copy here is how the pair drift apart:
--   Happiness  data/events/happiness_changes.asm, plus ChangeHappiness's tier
--              pick, its two carry clamps and its `cp EGG / ret z`.
--   Roamers    InitRoamMons' three wRoamMon structs, plus the roam walk that
--              indexes them BY SLOT.
--   BugContest data/wild/bug_contest_mons.asm, ContestScore's tally, the ten
--              contestants and the podium, plus the twenty minute clock.
--   Apricorns  data/items/apricorn_balls.asm and FindApricornsInBag's walk of

-- a nine-state jumptable; this ports its shape rather than its byte, with two
-- of its own behaviours kept on purpose:
--
--   * StoreMoney/TakeMoney's insufficient-funds arms `ret` WITHOUT advancing
--     wJumptableIndex, so `.loop` re-enters the SAME state and asks again --
--     the `while true do` loops below stand in for that.
--   * GiveMoney does not refuse an over-the-cap deposit, it CLAMPS to
--     MAX_MONEY and reports carry; the caller sees that as "no room" but the
--     clamp already landed, so a deposit that overflows Mom's account still
--     tops her out at 999999 without touching the wallet (`giveMoneyClamped`
--     below is exactly that GiveMoney, not a rejecting one).
--
-- Not ported: the `.nope` arm of IsThisAboutYourMoney calls DSTChecks, which
-- nudges wStartHour/wStartDay to flip Daylight Saving on or off and reprints
-- the clock.  This port has no wStartHour to nudge -- World:hour reads the
-- host clock directly rather than keeping an offset from it (SetDayOfWeek's
-- own comment above says the same for the day wheel) -- so there is nothing
-- for a yes/no here to change, and the conversation falls straight through to
-- MomJustDoWhatYouCanText the way it does once DSTChecks itself returns.
--
-- data/text/common_1.asm, transcribed the way MOVE_DELETER_TEXT above
-- transcribes its own bank, and with the cart's own page structure: `para` is
-- a page break (`\f` -- the box clears and WAITS for A), `cont` is the
-- scrolled third line (`\v`, which also waits).  Folding paras into plain
-- `\n`s let the whole of MomLeavingText1 type itself out as one page with no

--
-- MagnetTrain (engine/events/magnet_train.asm), the Goldenrod <-> Saffron ride
-- both station officers run once EVENT_RESTORED_POWER_TO_KANTO is set and the
-- PASS is in the bag.  The routine READS wScriptVar and never writes it:
--
--     ld a, [wScriptVar]
--     and a
--     jr nz, .ToGoldenrod
--
-- so the `setval FALSE` in front of the Goldenrod call and the `setval TRUE` in
-- front of the Saffron one are what pick the direction, and vm.scriptVar has to
-- come back out of here exactly as it went in -- the `warpcheck` that follows
-- reads nothing, but a handler that clobbered it would still be lying about
-- what the routine does.
--
-- The ride itself is src/core/gen2/MagnetTrain.lua and its screen is
-- src/ui/gen2/MagnetTrainRide.lua; World:magnetTrain is the push.  With no hook
-- the special is a no-op that leaves the script to warp on its own, which is
-- what a headless run wants.

-- writetext .Question / yesorno / iffalse .Refused / writetext .Yes /
-- waitbutton / special PhotoStudio / waitbutton / closetext` -- the yes/no
-- gate and the surrounding textbox both belong to the map script (generic
-- VM opcodes; nothing to hand-port there), and PhotoStudio itself only ever
-- runs after the player has said yes.  Like H.MoveDeletion and H.NameRater,
-- it never writes wScriptVar (no `ld [wScriptVar], a` anywhere in the
-- routine), so this leaves vm.scriptVar exactly as `special` found it.
--
-- data/text/common_1.asm _WhichMonPhotoText/_HoldStillText/
-- _PrestoAllDoneText/_NoPhotoText/_EggPhotoText, transcribed the way
-- MOVE_DELETER_TEXT above transcribes its own bank.
--
-- farcall PrintPartymon (engine/printer/printer.asm) is the actual camera:
-- it draws the portrait card (src/ui/gen2/PhotoStudio.lua transcribes that
-- layout, PrintPartyMonPage1) and then SendScreenToPrinter walks it out the
-- serial port to a physical Game Boy Printer.  There is no peripheral for it
-- to reach here -- the same reason H.UnownPrinter's A press goes nowhere and
-- PrintDiploma's own print goes nowhere -- so `ldh a, [hPrinter] / and a / jr nz,
-- .cancel` is
-- hardwired to the nz arm below: the portrait shows, then the print always
-- comes back as though the printer errored, which is the honest answer for
