-- `callasm` / `memcall` / `memcallasm` / `memjump`: the four script commands
-- whose operand is not bytecode.
--
-- Script_callasm (engine/overworld/scripting.asm) reads a three-byte far
-- pointer out of the script and `rst FarCall`s it as raw Game Boy code.
-- Script_memcallasm does the same with a pointer read out of WRAM instead;
-- Script_memcall calls the WRAM pointer as bytecode, and Script_memjump jumps
-- to it and never comes back.  No interpreter can run any of them, so each
-- target routine needs its own hand port, and this file is where they live.
--
-- Dispatch is BY ADDRESS, the way src/script/gen2/Specials.lua dispatches by
-- name.  SITES maps the `bank:addr` pair the command carries -- resolved
-- against pokegold-symbols/pokegold.sym -- onto a routine name, and HANDLERS
-- maps that name onto the port.  Keying on the pair rather than on a counted
-- index means a routine that moved between revisions cannot silently call the
-- wrong port; keying the port on the NAME means the table can be asserted
-- against the symbol file by a test.
--
-- WHAT wScriptVar DOES AND DOES NOT GET WRITTEN.  Script_callasm itself never
-- touches wScriptVar: it is the TARGET routine that does, and only eleven of
-- them do.  A handler therefore returns a byte only when its asm ends in
-- `ld [wScriptVar], a`, and nil otherwise -- nil meaning "leave it alone".
-- Inventing a 0 or a 1 for the rest would pick a branch at random for the
-- `callasm` / `iffalse` pairs (FindItemInBallScript and FruitTreeScript are
-- both one), which is exactly the bug this contract exists to prevent.
--
-- WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN THE CACHE: nothing.  Thirty-eight rows in
-- data/generated/scripts.lua used to carry one of these four opcodes and not
-- one of them was real -- every one sat inside a key the extractor had made
-- out of a three-byte `hiddenitem` bg_event operand (45:697a is
-- IlexForestHiddenEther, 47:40a5 is WhirlIslandB1FHiddenRareCandy) and then
-- disassembled as if it were code.  A cache built since the extractor stopped
-- walking those operands has none at all, and a stale one still misses SITES
-- because its bank/address pairs are noise; tests/gen2_callasm_test.lua
-- asserts that neither resolves.
--
-- The real sites are the fifty-seven in engine/*.asm listed below.  None of
-- those engine scripts is reachable from a map script pointer, so none of them
-- is extracted either, and the port reaches their routines through the
-- hand-ported flows in src/world/gen2/ -- which is why CallAsm.run is a public
-- entry point beside CallAsm.dispatch.  Both roads end at the same table,
-- which is the point of having one.
--
-- love-free: a handler takes the World (or anything shaped like it) and calls
-- back into the module that already owns the behaviour.  Nothing here
-- re-transcribes a table that has a home elsewhere.
