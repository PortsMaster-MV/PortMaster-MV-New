-- ---- the mod verb table ----------------------------------------------------
--
-- THE CONTRACT.  Read this before adding a caller.
--
-- Gen 1 scripts are hand-written row lists ({ "command", args... }) and a mod
-- extends the language by registering a verb into the `commands` registry, which
-- src/script/ScriptRunner.lua:150 resolves by NAME on every row.  There is no
-- name to resolve here: this VM runs the CART's bytecode, where a command is an
-- opcode byte and every byte that means anything already means something
-- (src/script/gen2/Opcodes.lua).  Handing mods one of the free bytes would be
-- worse than useless -- ROM data that happens to start with it would decode as a
-- mod call instead of ending the pointer walk.
--
-- So the seam is a row the CART CANNOT WRITE.  Opcodes.MOD_COMMAND
-- ("modcommand") is an op name with no byte behind it, and the extractor only
-- ever stamps names out of the byte table plus its own "unknown" / "truncated"
-- pair.  A stock Gold boot therefore decodes byte for byte as it did before this
-- function existed and can never reach it; what reaches it is a row a mod wrote,
-- in either of two shapes:
--
--   { op = "modcommand", verb = "mymod:shake", args = { 4, 2 } }   -- native
--   { "mymod:shake", 4, 2 }                                        -- Gen 1 row
--
-- The second is the Gen 1 row shape verbatim (runList normalises it), so a mod
-- can ship ONE row list for both games as long as every row in it is its own
-- verb.  A list like that is runnable today: Vm:start and Vm:runCallback both
-- take a table of rows as well as a scripts.lua key, and `scall` / `sjump`
-- targets are keys into the same pool.
--
-- The verb resolves against the SAME registry Gen 1 uses -- same registry name
-- `commands`, same record shape, a bare function or the flagged table
-- { fn, foreground, blocking } that src/script/Commands.lua:1381-1390 unpacks --
-- reached through hooks.commands at Vm.new, or through Vm.setCommands for a boot
-- path with no way into that hooks literal.  `foreground` and `blocking` are
-- unpacked and ignored: they exist for Gen 1's parallel ambient runner, and this
-- VM has one script frame, so there is no second runner for them to mean
-- anything against.
--
-- The handler is called as fn(ctx, unpack(args)) with the same per-run ctx every
-- other mod-facing site in this file hands out (Vm:scriptCtx): ctx.vm where Gen 1
-- has ctx.runner, and no ctx.game / ctx.save / ctx.overworld, because this VM
-- owns none of them.  Its return value speaks runCmd's vocabulary, which is Gen
-- 1's control-command vocabulary: "end" ends the list, a number is a 1-based row
-- to continue at, nil falls through to the next row.  A verb may block exactly
-- the way a command does -- ctx.vm:showText, :showRaw and :waitFrames all yield
-- the VM's coroutine and Vm:resume drives them back.

-- ---- the mod-facing script lifecycle ---------------------------------------
--
-- `script.started` / `script.ended` / `script.command` are the SAME three names
-- and the same payload keys the Gen 1 runner raises
-- (src/script/ScriptRunner.lua:119-190): both events carry { ctx = ... } and
-- `script.ended` additionally carries completed = true/false, so a mod that
-- brackets a run works unchanged on Gold.
--
-- What the names MEAN differs, and pretending otherwise would be the lie:
-- Gen 1's ctx is a bag of engine services (game, overworld, save, runner) plus
-- the row list's own extras, because a Gen 1 script is hand-ported rows this
-- engine wrote.  This VM runs the CART's bytecode; it owns no Game and no save,
-- and the facts that identify a run are the cart's own -- which map it belongs
-- to, which script pointer it started at, and which map object it hangs off.
-- Those are what go in, plus `vm` as the analogue of Gen 1's `runner` and
-- `generation` so a shared mod can tell the two apart without guessing.
--
-- The ctx is built once per run and memoised: a script that runs 200 commands
-- with a `script.command` wrapper installed must not build 200 tables, and the
-- Gen 1 runner likewise hands the same table to every command in a run.
