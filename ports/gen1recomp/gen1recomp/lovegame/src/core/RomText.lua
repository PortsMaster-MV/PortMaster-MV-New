-- The line the game itself prints, with the engine's wording as backup.
--
-- pokered prints most of what the player reads -- battle messages, item
-- results, field prompts -- and the importer extracts every one of those
-- labels.  Writing the sentence again in Lua meant the screen showed a
-- near-miss of the game's own wording while the cache held the real line,
-- and on a localized import it showed English over translated data.
--
-- Callers pass the pokered label plus the literal they used to print, so
-- the literal stays catalog-backed (Strings) for a cache built before the
-- label, for a total conversion that dropped it, and for the pure-module
-- tests that run without a dataset.
--
-- The slots the extracted text carries ({USER}, {TARGET}, the {RAM:...}
-- buffers) are NOT in the token registry TextBox.substitute serves -- that
-- one only resolves {PLAYER}, {RIVAL} and three string buffers -- so they
-- are filled here, in argument order, before the box ever sees the string.
--
-- {PLAYER}/{RIVAL} are the two the registry CAN fill later, so they are
-- only consumed here when the caller clearly supplies them: an argument
-- count matching every slot.  Matching just the other slots leaves those
-- two alone for that pass.  Anything else means the extracted line cannot
-- carry what the call has to say -- a few labels stop at a dynamic marker
-- the decoder does not follow, e.g. _EnemysWeakText extracts as "The
-- enemy's weak!\nGet'm! " with nowhere to put the name -- so the engine's
-- own wording stands in rather than printing a sentence with a hole in it.
