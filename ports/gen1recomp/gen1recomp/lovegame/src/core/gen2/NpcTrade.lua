-- The in-game trades (engine/events/npc_trade.asm, data/events/npc_trades.asm).
--
-- Six of them, one per NPC_TRADE_* constant, reached by the `trade` script
-- command.  Each row names the mon the NPC wants, the mon it hands over, and
-- everything that mon arrives wearing: its nickname, its DVs, its held item,
-- its original trainer's name and ID, and which gender of the requested mon it
-- will accept.
--
-- love-free: the conversation is src/ui/gen2/TradeMenu.lua, this is the rules.
--
-- Facts worth keeping:
--
--   * NPCTRADE_GIVEMON is what YOU hand over and NPCTRADE_GETMON what you get,
--     which is the opposite way round from the macro's own argument comment
--     ("requested mon, offered mon").  GetTradeAttr reads them by name, so the
--     comment is the only thing that is backwards.
--   * The row's DVs are TWO RAW BYTES, not a number: attack/defense in the
--     high and low nibbles of the first, speed/special of the second.  The
--     mon's gender and shininess fall straight out of them, which is why every
--     one of these trades hands over the same mon to every player.
--   * The OT ID is stored little-endian in the table and byte-swapped into the
--     party struct (Trade_CopyTwoBytesReverseEndian), so the number the table
--     holds IS the ID the player sees.
--   * `trade` writes no wScriptVar.  Every outcome -- the refusal, the wrong
--     mon, the completed trade -- prints its line and returns, and the script
--     after it carries on either way.
--   * The trade is one-shot, tracked in wTradeFlags by the trade's own id.  A
--     second visit prints TRADE_DIALOG_AFTER and nothing else, which is the
--     check that happens BEFORE the intro line.
--   * ComputeNPCTrademonStats runs at the END, on the mon that just landed in
--     the last party slot: the received mon keeps the LEVEL of the one handed
--     over and recomputes its stats from the new species' bases.
