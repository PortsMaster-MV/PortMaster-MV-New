-- Gen 2 save file.
--
-- Deliberately separate from src/core/SaveData.lua rather than a branch inside
-- it: that module's shape is Gen 1's SRAM (Kanto badges, 12 boxes of 20,
-- pikachu happiness, the Gen 1 party struct with one `special` stat), and its
-- validate/migration chain asserts against that shape.  A Gold save has a
-- different party struct (SpA/SpD, held item, happiness, pokerus), different
-- boxes, a phone book, a Pokedex with two orderings, and an RTC.
--
-- What IS shared, on purpose:
--   * SaveSerializer, so both generations' files are the same Lua-table format
--     and the standalone save editor can read either
--   * the save-file naming convention (GameVersion.saveSuffix -> save_gold.lua
--     plus .bak / .tmp), so Gold sits beside Red/Blue/Yellow without touching
--     them, and the same atomic write dance protects it
--   * options.lua, which is version-independent and survives New Game
--
-- Layout notes taken from the cart: a New Game starts at SPAWN_HOME
-- (PLAYERS_HOUSE_2F 3,3 -- engine/menus/intro_menu.asm NewGame), the money cap
-- is 999999, and playtime is kept as h/m/s/frames the way wGameTime* is.

-- Bumped whenever a field's meaning changes; migrations key off it.
--
--   1 -> 2  the Hall of Fame roster (sHallOfFame + wHallOfFameCount) and
--           wSpawnAfterChampion.  A format-1 save predates the endgame, so it
--           has neither and the migration is the empty roster.
--   2 -> 3  scriptMem, the script VM's sparse WRAM store.  A format-2 save
--           kept those bytes per-session, so the migration is the empty table:
--           every address reads back as 0, which is what the cart's own
--           zero-filled WRAM gives a save that never touched one.
--   3 -> 4  mail: sPartyMail (six `mailmsg` structs keyed by PARTY SLOT) and
--           sMailboxes + sMailboxCount (the PC's MAILBOX).  A format-3 save
--           has neither and cannot have a letter anywhere, so the upgrade is
--           the empty pair -- and a mon in one of those saves carrying a MAIL
--           item is exactly the case Mail.sendToPc's blank-struct fallback
--           covers.
--   4 -> 5  `events` (wEventFlags) and `mapScenes` (the w<Map>SceneID block)
--           became LOAD BEARING.  Both fields existed in format 4 and both
--           were written on every save, but nothing ever read them back --
--           World:loadPlayerData is what does now -- so a format-4 file's
--           copies had never been validated by anything.  The migration is
--           the pair of tables; Save.validate is what scrubs them from here
--           on, the same way it always has for scriptMem.
--   5 -> 6  `playerState` (wPlayerState), which sits in the same sPlayerData
--           block the two fields above do and had never been written at all:
--           a format-5 save made on the BICYCLE or aboard a Lapras came back
--           on foot.  There is nothing to carry across, so the upgrade is
--           PLAYER_NORMAL -- the cart's own zero byte, and what those files
--           have effectively been loading as all along.
--   6 -> 7  `mom.whichItem` (wWhichMomItem) and `mom.triggerBalance`
--           (wMomItemTriggerBalance), the two bytes MomTriesToBuySomething
--           walks (src/core/gen2/MomShopping.lua).  NewGame seeds them in
--           engine/menus/intro_menu.asm, so a file made before Mom could
--           spend anything upgrades to exactly those seeds: the ladder on its
--           first rung and the consolation threshold at MOM_MONEY.  A save
--           that already has savings banked therefore starts buying from the
--           bottom of the list, which is what a cartridge whose owner had
--           saved that much would also do.
--   7 -> 8  Crystal caught data: a mon carrying a caught level but no landmark
--           is zeroed, so the Seer takes ReadCaughtData's `.error` arm
--           (../pokecrystal/engine/events/poke_seer.asm:103-104) instead of
--           GetCaughtLocation's "Unknown".  #1929
