-- Gen 2 evolution: which species a party member turns into, whether its
-- condition is met right now, and what the party record becomes afterwards.
--
-- Love-free on purpose, the same way src/core/gen2/Boxes.lua is: every
-- question a screen asks here is table math over data/generated/pokemon.lua's
-- `evolutions` rows, so tests/gen2_evolution_test.lua can drive a whole
-- evolution with no window.  src/ui/gen2/EvolutionAnim.lua is the only half
-- that draws.
--
-- Ported from engine/pokemon/evolve.asm:
--   EvolveAfterBattle          the master loop over the party, one flagged
--                              slot at a time, and the condition walk inside
--                              each species' EvosAttacks rows
--   UpdateSpeciesNameIfNotNicknamed   the nickname keeps only if it is a real
--                              nickname and not the old species' own name
--   LearnLevelMoves            the new species' moves for the level it is
--                              already at, run right after the pic changes
-- and the frame counts of engine/movie/evolution_animation.asm, which live
-- here rather than in the screen so the schedule is assertable.
--
-- What flags a slot: engine/battle/core.asm sets wEvolvableFlags for a mon the
-- moment it levels up (right after its LearnLevelMoves run), and ExitBattle
-- calls EvolveAfterBattle only on a win.  src/ui/gen2/BattleState.lua keeps
-- that flag set from the battle's own `level` events.
--
-- Everything a party member becomes is built by src/battle/gen2/Mon.lua and
-- nothing else: Evolution.apply recomputes stats through Mon.stats and rebuilds
-- the record through Mon.new, so an evolved mon can never end up with the
-- half-filled shape a second builder would hand back.
