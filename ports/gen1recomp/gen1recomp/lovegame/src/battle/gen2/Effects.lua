-- Gen 2 move effects, as data plus the small amount of arithmetic each one
-- needs.  Ported from engine/battle/effect_commands.asm; the battle engine
-- (src/battle/gen2/Battle.lua) owns the turn loop and calls in here for what a
-- move does beyond "roll damage, maybe inflict a status".
--
-- Everything is keyed by the move's *effect*, the same byte data/moves/moves.asm
-- stores, so a modded move that copies an effect inherits its behaviour -- and
-- an effect this table does not name still lands as an ordinary hit rather than
-- silently doing the wrong thing.
--
-- No love calls and no engine state: every function takes what it needs and
-- returns a value or a small table, which is what lets the tests drive them
-- directly.
