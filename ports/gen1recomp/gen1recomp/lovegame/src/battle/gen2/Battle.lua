-- Gen 2 battle engine: the turn loop, as pure logic.
--
-- No love calls and no rendering: a battle is a state machine that consumes
-- actions and produces a queue of events, so the same engine drives the screen
-- (src/ui/gen2/BattleState.lua), a headless driver, and the tests.  Gen 1's
-- src/battle/BattleState.lua interleaves logic with drawing, which is exactly
-- what makes its turn order hard to assert; this does not repeat that.
--
-- Ported from engine/battle/core.asm's turn structure:
--   * both sides choose (a move, an item, a switch, or run)
--   * order is by Speed after stat stages, with a coin flip on a tie
--     (DetermineMoveOrder); a switch or item always goes first
--   * each attack: PP, status gates (sleep/freeze/paralysis), accuracy, damage,
--     then the move's secondary effect
--   * end of turn: burn and poison tick, then faint checks and experience
--
-- Status handling follows Gen 2's rules rather than Gen 1's: burn is 1/8 max HP
-- (not 1/16) and halves physical Attack, poison is 1/8, and sleep counts down
-- from 2-7 turns.

-- Two shape differences are unavoidable and are called out at each site:

--
--   primary    the effect runs INSTEAD of the damage path.  Both the
--              state-setting commands above (`run`) and the zero-power status
--              moves (`status`) are primary; which one a record is is which
--              field it carries.
--   secondary  a side-effect rolled against the move's effect chance after a
--              hit that already landed.
--
-- `run` is the Gold signature fn(battle, attacker, defender, def, moveId,
-- sureHit), the same six arguments useMove has always dispatched on -- Gen 1's
-- run takes its own engine's context for the same reason the status records
-- above do.
--
-- One field Gen 2 adds rather than renaming anything: `status`, the name the
-- effect writes into mon.status, which is what makes EFFECT_TOXIC and
-- EFFECT_POISON_HIT records rather than two more lookup tables.  Effects that
-- are steered from inside the damage pipeline (EFFECT_MULTI_HIT, the recoil
-- and drain families) have no standalone handler and so no record yet, exactly
-- as Gen 1's "full" effects have none: they fall through to the damage path,
-- which is what keeps an unmodelled effect honest.

-- `pairs(registry.ops)` traversal (inserting into move_effects any later

-- ------------------------------------------------------------ the statuses
--
-- Gold's persistent conditions as records, in the shape src/mods/Schemas.lua's
-- `statuses` registry validates.  Same registry NAME Gen 1 fills from
-- src/battle/Status.lua, because a mod that adds a status should not have to
-- learn a second noun -- only the ids differ, and they have to: Gold's engine
-- writes "sleep" and "burn" into mon.status where Red writes SLP and BRN.
--
-- The Gen 1 fields keep their Gen 1 meaning:
--
--   label / hudLabel        the three-letter code the HUD draws
--   catchBonus              what PokeBallEffect adds to the catch rate
--   statPenalty             the one stat this status cuts, and by what
--   beforeMove              CheckPlayerTurn's arm, run before the move
--   beforeMovePriority      above VOLATILE_PRIORITY runs ahead of the
--                           flinch/confusion block, at or below after it,
--                           which is CheckPlayerTurn's own order
--   residual                the end-of-turn chip, HandleStatusOnTurnEnd
--
-- Their SIGNATURES are Gold's, because the two engines carry different
-- objects: Gen 1 hands a battler wrapper and returns message lists, Gold has
-- no battler wrapper and emits its own events, so beforeMove is
-- fn(battle, mon, name) -> canAct, residual is fn(battle, mon, maxHp) ->
-- damage, text, and onInflict is fn(battle, mon) with no return.  A record is
-- generation-specific either way -- the ids are disjoint -- so the field names
-- stay shared and the shapes follow the engine that runs them.
--
-- Three fields Gen 2 genuinely carries that Gen 1 does not, added rather than
-- renaming anything (the catalog's top-level records are extensible):
--
--   inflictText          the tail of the landing line, spliced after the name
--   catchBonusIntended   the bonus the cart MEANT to give: the `and` that
--                        tests for sleep/freeze leaves burn, poison and
--                        paralysis at zero, so catchBonus is 0 for them and
--                        this is the 5 that `fixBugs` asks for
--                        (src/battle/gen2/Catching.lua statusBonus)
--   substatus            true for confusion, which is SUBSTATUS_CONFUSED and
--                        not a status byte at all
--   healClass            the StatusHealingActions class that cures it, which
--                        is how a mod status becomes curable: src/core/gen2/
--                        ItemEffects.lua reads it for any spelling its own
--                        STATUS_CLASS fold does not already know
--
-- Every consumer below reads through Battle:statusRecord, so a mod's sixth
-- status inflicts, chips, blocks a turn and cuts a stat like the vanilla six.
