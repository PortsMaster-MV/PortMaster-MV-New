-- Transcribed rather than laid out by eye.  A Pokegear card is not a layout at
-- all -- it is a tilemap.  InitPokegearTilemap fills the screen with $4f, runs
-- the card's own entry, and then Pokegear_FinishTilemap lays the card strip
-- across the top two rows.  Three of the four cards are stored as RLE
-- tilemaps in the ROM (Pokegear_LoadTilemapRLE, whose comment has its own
-- format backwards: the first byte is the tile and the second the count) and
-- the MAP card is the painted region map, JohtoMap / KantoMap.
--
-- Both sheets live in one 96-tile block: Pokegear_LoadGFX puts TownMapGFX at
-- vTiles2 $00 and PokegearGFX at $30, so a tilemap byte under $30 is town map
-- art and anything above it is gear chrome.  Colour is by tile id rather than
-- by rectangle -- TownMapPals walks the tilemap and reads a nybble per tile
-- out of its PalMap, with $60 and up falling back to palette 0.
--

-- each owned card's 2x2 icon is laid as n, n+1 / n+$10, n+$11 -- MAP at (2,0)
-- from $40, PHONE at (4,0) from $44, RADIO at (6,0) from $42, and the gear
