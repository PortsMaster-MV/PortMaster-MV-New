# AM2R - PortMaster + Community Patch
The latest AM2R experience is v1.5.5. Follow the below steps to obtain this version and set it up for PortMaster use.

## Installation
You will need the following:

- AM2R v1.1 (search for this on the web, DoctorM64 is a known and trusted source)
- OPTIONAL: The [community developer patch data](https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2R-Autopatcher-Windows/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

Copy both zip files (naming doesn't matter) to `ports/am2r/assets` and run the port. It may take some time to install. If you don't want to use the community patch, only copy AM2R v1.1.
