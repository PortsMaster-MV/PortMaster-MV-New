### Controls

In addition to the usual controls, the settings menu can be enabled/dismissed with L3 and navigated with dpad, A and B.


### Performance

This is a prerelease version of the port, and there are likely to be some rough edges. In particular, there are some graphical glitches, e.g. affecting item boxes. On lower-powered devices, there are also some audio glitches in menus and at start of races, though races themselves seem OK. This will hopefully these will be ironed out in future.
