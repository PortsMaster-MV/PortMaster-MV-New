# Pokéwilds - PortMaster
This port of Pokewilds is made possible with the use of Westonpack by BinaryCounter.

## Installation
After installing the port, download the Windows game from https://github.com/SheerSt/pokewilds/releases and extract the `mods` and `app` folders, as well as `settings.txt`, into `ports/pokewilds/bin`.

You also need to install the following runtimes using the PortMaster app:
- Westonpack 0.2 (weston_pkg_0.2.aarch64.squashfs) -- If you're not using a mainline firmware
- Java 17.0.13 (zulu17.54.21-ca-jre17.0.13-linux.aarch64.squashfs)

## Mods
Mods can enhance the look and gameplay. Some notable mods:

- [Gen 3 Overhaul Mod by BansheeStudio](https://github.com/BansheeStudio/PokemonWildsGen3Overhaul)
- [Pokewilds Android via Termux by Kuze2571](https://github.com/Kuze2571/Pokewilds-Termux)

More mods can be found on the [Pokewilds Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jdkV7F3AjA).

## Notes
This game has a large RAM footprint and uses more memory over time. Therefore it has been classified as an `ultra` port and will only run efficiently on Retroid Pocket 5, Retroid Pocket Mini, RetroDeck, etc. However, it *should* also run well on any device with more than `2GB` of memory like the Anbernic RG552. `2GB` devices may also work with the use of included zram tool, but it's untested.
