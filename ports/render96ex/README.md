## Notes

Thanks to [Render96](https://linktr.ee/Render96) team for developping this port and to [Retro Aesthetics](https://retroaesthetics.net/) team for the huge work on the 3D models.

I also have to say a big thank you to my fellow testers.

## Disclaimer

You must own a legal copy of the Super Mario 64 rom.

**Don't ask Portmaster for help on how to obtain this copy.**

## Game data files needed:

Copy your Super Mario 64 rom as *baserom.us.z64* to the root of the *render96ex* folder. The patcher will install the assets from the rom and packages on the first launch.

**Only the US version of the ROM is supported in this port.**

The SHA1 sum of *baserom.us.z64* is *9bef1128717f958171a4afac3ed78ee2bb4e86ce*.
The MD5 sum of *baserom.us.z64* is *20b854b239203baf6c961b850a4a51a2*.

## Optional packages

This port comes with 3 optional packages:
* HD gfx textures pack, a lowmem resize version of [RENDER96-HD-TEXTURE-PACK](https://github.com/pokeheadroom/RENDER96-HD-TEXTURE-PACK/).
* Dynos audio pack, a lowmem resampled version (22.05 kHz) from the [Rendex96ex](https://github.com/Render96/Render96ex) project.
* Dynos 3D model pack, a lowmem resized version of [Render96 Alpha v3.1 modelpack](https://github.com/Render96/ModelPack). 

## Important notes

The extraction of the assets from the rom will temporary uses up to 1 GB of extra storage. Be sure to have at least this amount of free space before launching the game for the first time or it will fail.

The Dynos 3D model pack is installed but not enabled by default because on most handheld the game will be choppy when combined with the 60 fps feature. You have to enable it in the dynos menu.

The 60 fps feature is enabled by default. If your device can not handle it and the game is running choppy you can try to disable it in the display options in the option menu. Then wait few seconds to let the framerate stabilize.

You may need to adjust your gamepad configuration in the option menu depending on your CFW and the handheld model.

If you have updated the port and still have control issues with D-PAD only handheld (weird shoulder button ghost inputs for exemple) try to reset the configuration, see here below **How to reset configuration**. 

## Menus

The option menu can be accessed during the game by pressing **Start** then **R1** (this is R on N64 gamepad).

The Dynos menu can be accessed during the game by pressing **Start** then **L2** (this is Z on N64 gamepad).

## How to reset configuration

If you did something wrong in the configuration (option menu) and the game won't start anymore you can reset to default by deleting/renaming *render96ex/conf/sm64config.txt*.

If you did something wrong in the dynos configuration (dynos menu) and the game won't start anymore you can reset to default by deleting/renaming *render96ex/conf/DynOS.1.1.alpha.config.txt*.
