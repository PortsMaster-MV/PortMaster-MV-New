    <desc>With this project I am willing to replicate the behaviour of the original Donkey Kong by Nintendo.
      I tried to simulate the game logic and timing spending multiple hours watching videos of the original game.
      Game programming is now completed with four brand new levels added on the top of the 4 original ones.</desc>
