My name is Matt, working on ports for the PortMaster Project.
https://github.com/christianhaitian/PortMaster

We make various games and ports runable on small linux handhelds and share them with the community. Recently I have been adding some Gamemaker games and I'd love to include your games as well.

I know that sites like itch.io are already distributing the files, but I like to ask for permission from the creator to make sure it is ok. You will of course be credited as the creator, and we do not need any additional/source code or anything, just your permission to distribute. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Your games would make a great addition on these small handhelds.

Thanks in advance!
Matt

Hi, Matt!

yes, you can distribute it.

will you need to recompile the project? if so, that may prove a little tricky since all assets are absent from the source and you need to extract them from original copy of Nuclear Throne.

and I'd like to know how you handle updates, since there's one planned to be released soon(-ish) and it will be almost undoubtedly supported and receiving patches for additional week or two. 

also, there is a built-in update checker which shows itch.io page by a prompt - wouldn't this be undesired?

I do not need to recompile, I have the 2527 build running on my device and ready for our beta testers. The way our project is currently setup I will be manually updating, as I need to ensure that compatibility does not get broken, but we will certainly be keeping it up to date. Regarding the built in update checker, unfortunately most functions utilizing a network connect will not work due to the nature of the devices and the way the games run on them, but links to your itch.io (and any other sites/links you may prefer) will be provided in our gui, wiki , and with any and all downloads of your game.
