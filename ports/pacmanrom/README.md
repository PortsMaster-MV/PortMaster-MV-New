## Notes

Gameplay appears relatively consistent with the classic "PacMan". Primary differences are:

* Player cannot see what PacMan cannot see
* Ghosts behaviors are... unique.
* Players who finish the original arcade game board suffer severe psychological and occasionally physiological trauma, up to and including death of the subject (ROM's effect is significantly reduced).
