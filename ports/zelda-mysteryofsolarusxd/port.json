Though itâs a big April 1st joke, itâs a real, full game with two huge dungeons and 5-10 hours of playing.\n\nIt was developed in a very short period of time, thanks to coffee, beer and pizzas. Though the development has been rushed to ship on time, the game is complete, with lots of jokes, references and quirky NPCs.",
