### How do I enter the `security code` in PokeMMO?

- Press: Select + Y to enable virtual keyboard.
- Press: Select to toggle number/text
- Dpad Up/Down to select value,  A to add, B to remove.
- Start to disable virtual keyboard.

### What is `hack.jar`?

`hack.jar` is a Java package that allows loading optimized shaders into memory for the following custom firmware (CFW).  
If a `credentials.txt` file exists, it will use the username and password specified there, but only during application startup.

The source code can be found here:

### üéÆ Experiencing FPS Drops?

The default configuration included with this port is optimized and tested for **low-end devices**, prioritizing compatibility and performance in **power-saving mode**.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è If You're Experiencing Lag:
- The most common reason for FPS drops is **changing the default FPS or render settings**. These defaults are intentionally conservative to ensure stable performance on less powerful hardware.
- If you have a more capable device, feel free to adjust these settings ‚Äî but keep in mind that doing so **may cause instability or performance issues**, especially if you're on low-spec hardware.

#### üìù About `main.properties`:
- This configuration file is tuned specifically for **very low-resource devices**.
- **Some areas may take longer to load**, especially the more demanding ones, but this is expected and **should not be frequent or break gameplay**.

‚úÖ If performance issues persist even with the default settings, let us know ‚Äî improvements and tweaks are always ongoing.

### Assigning Panfrost in Rocknix

To configure Rocknix to use the **Panfrost** driver, first ensure your device supports it and that it‚Äôs not the only available option. For example, the **Powkiddy RGB30** supports both **libMali (GLES 3.2)** and **Panfrost (GL 3.1/GLES 3.1)**, as shown [here](https://rocknix.org/devices/powkiddy/rgb30/#software).

To switch to the Panfrost driver:
![step 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lowlevel-1989/pokemmo-port/refs/heads/master/docs/1.jpg)
![step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lowlevel-1989/pokemmo-port/refs/heads/master/docs/2.jpg)


### 1. Install/Update the Port [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtAtlXwQsZw)

Download pokemmo.zip Place the `.zip` into:  
`/PortMaster/autoinstall`

Launch **PortMaster**. It will automatically install the port.

#### üìÇ Autoinstall Folder Locations

Here are the paths for the `autoinstall` folder for each CFW supported by PortMaster:

| System                             | `autoinstall` Path                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AmberELEC / ROCKNIX / uOS / Jelos** | `/roms/ports/PortMaster/autoinstall/`                                            |
| **muOS**                           | `/mmc/MUOS/PortMaster/autoinstall/`                                               |
| **ArkOS**                          | `/roms/tools/PortMaster/autoinstall/`                                             |
| **Knulli**                         | `/userdata/system/.local/share/PortMaster/autoinstall/`                           |

---

#### üì¶ Manual Installation (Alternative)

If the `autoinstall` folder method doesn't work, you can manually unzip the port contents into the appropriate `ports` folders.  
**Note:** This may break the port and prevent it from launching properly.

| System                             | Ports Folder Location                                                              |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AmberELEC / ROCKNIX / uOS / Jelos** | `/roms/ports/`                                                                     |
| **muOS**                           | Folders: `/mmc/ports/`  
|                                    | `.sh` files: `/mnt/mmc/ROMS/Ports/`                                                |
| **ArkOS**                          | `/roms/tools/PortMaster/autoinstall/` (same as autoinstall)                        |
| **Knulli**                         | `/userdata/system/.local/share/PortMaster/autoinstall/` (same as autoinstall)     |

### 2. Add Official PokeMMO Client Files

Go to the official PokeMMO website:  
[https://pokemmo.com/en/downloads/portable](https://pokemmo.com/en/downloads/portable)

Download the **portable version**, extract it, and copy these into:  
`/roms/ports/pokemmo/`

- `PokeMMO.exe`  
- `data/` folder

‚ö†Ô∏è  Make sure not to replace the existing shaders folder and main.properties, as it contains optimized shaders.
Replacing them may negatively impact performance on low-end devices.

---

### 3. Add Required and Optional ROMs

To add the ROMs, place them inside the PokeMMO/roms folder and set the following values in `main.properties`:
~~~
client.roms.nds=roms/pokemon_black.nds  
client.roms.em=roms/pokemon_emerald.gba  
client.roms.fr=roms/pokemon_firered.gba  
client.roms.nds2=roms/pokemon_platinum.nds  
client.roms.nds3=roms/pokemon_heartgold.nds
~~~

**Required ROM:**  
- Pok√©mon Black or White (Version 1)

**Optional ROMs (enable more regions):**  
- Fire Red  
- Emerald  
- Platinum  
- HeartGold / SoulSilver

---


### üéÆ Login Without Keyboard Input

If your device does not have a keyboard, you can try one of the following methods to log in:

#### üîß Option 1: PokeMMO/credentials.txt

Edit the file PokeMMO/credentials.txt with your login credentials.

#### üîß Option 2: Connect a Keyboard for First Login

Temporarily connect a physical keyboard (USB or Bluetooth), log in as usual, and make sure to check the **"Remember Me"** option.

#### üìù Option 3: Type Password in Username Field (thanks ddrsoul)

Type your password in the **username** field, then **copy and paste** it into the password field. This allows you to use system copy/paste functions even without a keyboard.

The game will now automatically log in when launched on PortMaster-compatible devices.
